# 1. Background  

Starting on August 2022, John Deere and the University of Georgia joined efforts to study the main drivers of cotton lint quality through a meta-analysis approach.  

## 1.1. Sites location and field data  
Since then, cotton fiber quality data from **24 site studies**  conducted in Georgia in 2020 were gathered.

From each site, harvested cotton seed was ginned and analyzed for lint quality. Quality variables included:  

- Fiber length  
- Fiber length uniformity  
- Micronaire  
- Strength  
- Reflectance (Rd)   
- Yellowness (+b)  
- Leaf percentage  

## 1.2. Environmental variables  
The centroid coordinates of each of the sites were used to retrieve and extract publicly available data sets for **daily weather** (PRISM, 4.6-km spatial resolution) and **soil properties** (POLARIS, 30-m spatial resolution).  

**Daily weather** variables of precipitation, air temperature (min, mean, max), and vapor pressure deficit were summarized (summed or averaged) on a monthly basis for the months between April and November. A total of **48 summarized weather variables** were created.  

**Soil properties** of bulk density, sand, clay, silt, organic matter, and pH for the layers 0-5, 5-15, and 15-30 cm depth were summarized by averaging within a site. A total of **19 summarized soil variables** were created.    

Each of the 7 lint quality variables were regressed against each of the summarized environmental variables, for a total of **469 models evaluated**. For each lint quality variable, the environmental variable model with the greatest correlation was selected.  

# 2. Results  
All cotton lint quality variables were significantly affected by environmental variables, with cumulative precipitation affecting 4 quality variables, temperature affecting 2 quality variables, and soil silt concentration affecting 1 quality variable. The **R2** of these models ranged from **0.28 to 0.45**.

Only 2 of 7 quality variables were negatively impacted by environmental variables. Fiber strength (the greater the better) decreased 0.02 grams/tex for each additional mm of precipitation in November, and reflectance (the greater the better) decreased 0.03% for each additional mm of precipitation in June.   

# 3. Next steps  
- Gather data from Georgia for 2021 and 2022 growing seasons.  
- Gather data **across the cotton belt** from the period between **1993 and 2019** through the [USDA Cotton Variety Trial data base](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/stoneville-ms/crop-genetics-research/docs/national-cotton-variety-test/).  

- Conduct **field studies** starting in 2023 to assess the specific effects of **nitrogen fertilizer** management (Dr. Bastos' program) and **insecticide** management (Dr. Roberts' program) on cotton lint quality.  

- A visiting scholar **student** has been identified and is being hired to continue leading the analytic workflow of this project.
