Only images with less than 40% cloud coverage were kept.\n\nImagery data were used to calculate green normalized difference index (GNDVI), from which pixel-based minimum, median, and maximum values were extracted and summarized as plots.\n\nImages were also used to create an animated time lapse of GNDVI during the selected period.\n\n# GNDVI summary statistics\n\n## Minimum\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2022_pasture_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Median\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2022_pasture_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Maximum\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2022_pasture_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# GNDVI timelapse\n\n![](data/2022pasture.gif)\n",
