    "text": "Hypothesis and Objectives\nWe hypothesize that\n\nDifferent cotton fiber quality variables are affected to different extents by genetics (choice of variety), environmental conditions (e.g., growing season rainfall volume and distribution, air and soil temperature, soil characteristics), management practices (seeding rate, fertilizer program, plant growth regulator and defoliant program, harvest date), and their interactions. \nIt is possible to dissect the main drivers of specific fiber quality parameters and overall loan rate.\n\nThe objective of this study is to use multi-site-year small-plot trial data collected across the Southern U.S.A. region to dissect the effects of genetics, environment, and management on different cotton fiber quality parameters and overall loan rate.\n\n\nTimeline\nA timeline for the proposed project is outlined in Figure 1. The project would officially start on July 2022 with data collection (field, environmental, and management) for the state of Georgia. The first report would be created by March of 2023 as a white paper for John Deere, with results potentially being presented at scientific conferences following non-disclosure agreement guidelines. After data and report for Georgia has been completed, efforts will shift to reach out to other cotton-producing states to broaden the scope of the database. The second and final report will be finished by June 2024, immediately shared with John Deere and potentially submitted for peer-reviewed journal publication following non-disclosure agreement guidelines.\n\n\n\nFig 1.

    "text": "Methods\nFor that, cotton harvesters with Harvest Identification technology were used in 9 commercial cotton fields. The harvesters collected yield data and included radio frequency identification tags to each module as they were assembled.\nUsing the harvest identification technology, we were able to georeference cotton quality parameters to sub-field locations, and match them with soil topography and remote sensing data.\nDifferent quality parameters like color, leaf grade, and strength, were used to calculate loan rate, which is a unified cotton quality number related to the value of cotton based on its quality. Loan rate is expressed in cents/lb cotton, and the larger it is, the higher quality cotton is and more a grower gets paid.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil topography data included elevation, slope, aspect, and flow direction. Here, we are only showing elevation for simplicity.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote sensing data was retrieved from the period between May 1st and August 31st from Sentinel-2 through Google Earth Engine for a total of 49 dates. Satellite data was used to calculate the green normalized difference index, GNDVI. GNDVI was summarized by extracting minimum, median, and maximum values during the growing season for each pixel in the field. Here, we are only showing GNDVI maximum for simplicity.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckout below a timelapse for all GNDVI images from which GNDVI max was extracted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary results and next steps\nWe found that greater loan rate values (>56 cents/lb cotton) were associated with lower elevation and lower growing-season maximum GNDVI for this field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, cotton quality can be spatially predicted using soil and remote sensing data.\nFuture work will include more fields with their associated weather data, more remote sensors, vegetation indices, and more complex machine learning algorithms to predict cotton quality.\nOnce validated, this project can be transformed into a tool that can impact different players in the cotton industry. For example, cotton growers will know what parts of their fields produce better quality cotton, and use this information for differential management and marketing purposes. On the other end, the textile industry will know what regions produce better-quality cotton. This information can be used to target the purchase of cotton from high-quality growing regions and ensure their yarn quality needs are met."
