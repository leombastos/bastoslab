    "text": "Starting on August 2022, John Deere and the University of Georgia joined efforts to study the main drivers of cotton lint quality through a meta-analysis approach.\n\n\nSince then, cotton fiber quality data from 24 site studies conducted in Georgia in 2020 were gathered.\n\nFrom each site, harvested cotton seed was ginned and analyzed for lint quality. Quality variables included:\n\nFiber length\n\nFiber length uniformity\n\nMicronaire\n\nStrength\n\nReflectance (Rd)\n\nYellowness (+b)\n\nLeaf percentage\n\n\n\n\nThe centroid coordinates of each of the sites were used to retrieve and extract publicly available data sets for daily weather (PRISM, 4.6-km spatial resolution) and soil properties (POLARIS, 30-m spatial resolution).\nDaily weather variables of precipitation, air temperature (min, mean, max), and vapor pressure deficit were summarized (summed or averaged) on a monthly basis for the months between April and November. A total of 48 summarized weather variables were created.\nSoil properties of bulk density, sand, clay, silt, organic matter, and pH for the layers 0-5, 5-15, and 15-30 cm depth were summarized by averaging within a site. A total of 19 summarized soil variables were created.\nEach of the 7 lint quality variables were regressed against each of the summarized environmental variables, for a total of 469 models evaluated. For each lint quality variable, the environmental variable model with the greatest correlation was selected."

Data types used in the course include publicly available like weather, soils, and satellite remote sensing, and private data like yield monitor, Veris-derived soil electrical conductivity and elevation, and drone remote sensing. Data processing steps include cleaning, removal of outliers, normalization, interpolation, and drone imagery processing. Analytical techniques include clustering for creation of management zones, zone-based and imagery-based variable rate prescription, profitability maps, and use of satellite remote sensing for crop scouting. All steps will be conducted utilizing the R statistical language to create well documented and reproducible precision agriculture analytical workflows. No previous knowledge in R is required.\n\n\nCourse learning outcomes\nProvide students with a good understanding of the emerging areas in precision agriculture, the ability to find, analyze and evaluate spatially distributed data sets, and the experience to use key precision agriculture tools and technologies. Additional goals are to:\n\nextend critical thinking and problem solving abilities\n\nimprove written and oral communication skills\n\nlearn how to create, present, and interpret maps\n\ncreate reproducible analytical workflows using R\n\n\n\nTopical Outline\n\nIntro to R\n\nUsing R as a geographic information system (GIS)\n\nAccessing publicly available geospatial data through R\n\nCrop statistics from USDA NASS\n\nSoils data from SSURGO\n\nWeather and satellite remote sensing\n\nState and county boundaries\n\n\nDigitizing field boundaries\n\nCreating grids for soil sampling\n\nGeostatistics for point-data interpolation Inverse distance weighting\n\nYield monitor data processing\n\nUnderstand the sources of error\n\nCleaning and removal of erroneous data points\n\nSpatial and temporal yield variability analysis\n\n\nTerrain data processing\n\nElevation\n\nAspect\n\nSlope\n\n\nManagement zones\n\nCombining yield and soils data\n\nCreating management zones with cluster analysis\n\nValidating management zones\n\n\nVariable rate prescription\n\nZone-based variable rate prescription\n\nImagery-based variable rate prescription\n\n\nProfitability maps\n\nSatellite remote sensing for crop scouting\n\nCourse final project\n\nThe topical outline is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary."

If a special circumstance arise (illness, travel, etc.), student absence or remote attendance must be informed to instructors prior to that class period.\nStudents on the Tifton and Griffin campuses may attend class in-person on their campuses or remote using the zoom link information. Student absence must be informed to instructors prior to that class period.\nPer Board of Regents policy, I reserve the right to drop students from the class roll who miss more than 5 class periods unexcused. Such students will be given a WF grade.\n\n\nDisclaimer\nThe course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.\n\n\nMake-up procedures\n\nThere will be no make-ups for missed quizzes. Any missed quiz will be recorded as a zero\n\nExams can be made up only with a note from a doctor or if you can document extenuating circumstances. Any unexcused missed exam will be recorded as a zero\n\nHomework assignments will be accepted up to one week beyond the due date. The penalty for submitting a late assignment is one letter grade\n\nHomework assignments may be submitted late without penalty in case of illness, extenuating circumstances, or if prior arrangements are made with the instructors. All late assignments are due within a week of the original due date or within a week of when a student returns from an illness\n\n\n\nMental Health and Wellness Resources\n\nIf you or someone you know needs assistance, you are encouraged to contact Student Care and Outreach in the Division of Student Affairs at 706-542-7774 or visit https://sco.uga.edu/.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nCotton is a perennial crop that we requires intensive management to be “annualized” (i.e., having a growing cycle that starts and ends within one growing season).\nBecause of its perennial nature, cotton growth needs to be modulated by i) providing both the proper amount of nutrients (where nitrogen-N is the one applied at greatest rates), and ii) ensuring its use of resources (like N) is properly partitioned between vegetative and reproductive growth. With that, optimum cotton lint yield is attained by providing enough (and not more than that) N while applying plant growth regulators (PGR) to curb excessive vegetative growth in lieu of reproductive.\nWithin-field variability in soil characteristics and properties like elevation, slope, texture, bulk density, organic matter, nutrient concentration, and pH can create variable cotton growth and yield potential. Cotton plants with variable growth will require different rates of N and PGR to attain proper vegetative/reproductive partitioning and achieve their yield potential. In-season variable rate N and PGR management can be used to better match input application rates with cotton growth requirements, increasing input use efficiency, optimizing yield, and increasing farm profitability.\nThe detection of within-field cotton growth variability and its proper management can be performed using crop canopy sensors. These sensors vary distance to the plants and in sensor-related resolutions (spatial, temporal, spectral, and radiometric). Commonly used crop canopy sensors include proximal (&lt;1 m from plants) and remote (ranging from 50 m with UAVs to orbital distances with satellite). Proximal and remote sensors have their own advantages and disadvantages, with proximal sensors generally being more sensitive to crop growth differences but less scalable than remote sensors.\n\n\nHypothesis and Objectives\nWe hypothesize that\n\nthe use of proximal, UAV, and satellite sensors will produce similar in-season variable rate N and PGR rates in cotton,\nsensor-based N and PGR management will yield at least similarly to a flat-rate approach,\nsensor-based N and PGR management will be more efficient in the use of N and PGR compared to a flat-rate approach.\n\nThe objectives of this study are to assess\n\nhow different are N and PGR rates when calculated using proximal, UAV, and satellite data,\nthe effect of sensor-based nutrient management in cotton lint yield and N and PGR use efficiency\n\n\n\nTimeline\nThis study will start in the Spring of 2023. A more detailed timeline will be created in the future."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nCotton profitability depends not only on lint yield but also on fiber quality, with price adjustments made based on quality parameters like length, strength, and micronaire. Cotton fiber quality varies both within a field and across years and is affected by genetics, environment, and management. Currently, studies reporting on the main drivers of cotton fiber quality are limited in space and/or time, and thus cannot be generalized. Therefore, there exists a gap in knowledge in dissecting the main and interacting effects of genetics, environment, and management in cotton fiber quality over multiple years and across multiple sites within a region.\n\n\nHypothesis and Objectives\nWe hypothesize that\n\nDifferent cotton fiber quality variables are affected to different extents by genetics (choice of variety), environmental conditions (e.g., growing season rainfall volume and distribution, air and soil temperature, soil characteristics), management practices (seeding rate, fertilizer program, plant growth regulator and defoliant program, harvest date), and their interactions. \nIt is possible to dissect the main drivers of specific fiber quality parameters and overall loan rate.\n\nThe objective of this study is to use multi-site-year small-plot trial data collected across the Southern U.S.A. region to dissect the effects of genetics, environment, and management on different cotton fiber quality parameters and overall loan rate.\n\n\nTimeline\nA timeline for the proposed project is outlined in Figure 1. The project would officially start on July 2022 with data collection (field, environmental, and management) for the state of Georgia. The first report would be created by March of 2023 as a white paper for John Deere, with results potentially being presented at scientific conferences following non-disclosure agreement guidelines. After data and report for Georgia has been completed, efforts will shift to reach out to other cotton-producing states to broaden the scope of the database. The second and final report will be finished by June 2024, immediately shared with John Deere and potentially submitted for peer-reviewed journal publication following non-disclosure agreement guidelines.\n\n\n\nFig 1.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nCotton quality is a very important aspect of cotton production because it directly influences how much a grower gets paid. Cotton is harvested and processed at a gin before samples can be taken for quality analysis, so learning about your cotton quality and final price can take a while.\nWhat if cotton growers could learn about cotton lint quality even before harvest? That is the task we set out to answer.\n\n\nMethods\nFor that, cotton harvesters with Harvest Identification technology were used in 9 commercial cotton fields. The harvesters collected yield data and included radio frequency identification tags to each module as they were assembled.\nUsing the harvest identification technology, we were able to georeference cotton quality parameters to sub-field locations, and match them with soil topography and remote sensing data.\nDifferent quality parameters like color, leaf grade, and strength, were used to calculate loan rate, which is a unified cotton quality number related to the value of cotton based on its quality. Loan rate is expressed in cents/lb cotton, and the larger it is, the higher quality cotton is and more a grower gets paid.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil topography data included elevation, slope, aspect, and flow direction. Here, we are only showing elevation for simplicity.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote sensing data was retrieved from the period between May 1st and August 31st from Sentinel-2 through Google Earth Engine for a total of 49 dates. Satellite data was used to calculate the green normalized difference index, GNDVI. GNDVI was summarized by extracting minimum, median, and maximum values during the growing season for each pixel in the field. Here, we are only showing GNDVI maximum for simplicity.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckout below a timelapse for all GNDVI images from which GNDVI max was extracted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary results and next steps\nWe found that greater loan rate values (&gt;56 cents/lb cotton) were associated with lower elevation and lower growing-season maximum GNDVI for this field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, cotton quality can be spatially predicted using soil and remote sensing data.\nFuture work will include more fields with their associated weather data, more remote sensors, vegetation indices, and more complex machine learning algorithms to predict cotton quality.\nOnce validated, this project can be transformed into a tool that can impact different players in the cotton industry. For example, cotton growers will know what parts of their fields produce better quality cotton, and use this information for differential management and marketing purposes. On the other end, the textile industry will know what regions produce better-quality cotton. This information can be used to target the purchase of cotton from high-quality growing regions and ensure their yarn quality needs are met."

For that, students will learn how to develop workflows that include finding and importing data, exploratory data analysis, data wrangling and processing, fitting a model to the data, assessing model quality, extracting model information, and creating publication-ready figures. This type of workflow will be implemented to both designed and observational data commonly found in agricultural sciences, including analysis of variance, regression, and machine learning algorithms. Students will learn how access publicly available data sets for crop, soils, and weather information, and train machine learning models on these data. All the above will be performed while learning and using data science tools for reproducibility like version control, R statistical programming, APIs to publicly available data sets, task automation, and creating online interactive dashboards."

Join our Slack workspace  \nAll communications about the workshop will happen in our Slack workspace.\nSlack is an application that is used for teams and projects communication, and can be used both on your browser and phone.\nFor more information about Slack, check their website.\nIf you have registered for the workshop, you will receive an invitation to join our Slack workspace by email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIn case you have not received the invitation, send me an email at lmbastos@ksu.edu with your full name, and I will add you once I confirm you are registered.\n\n\n\nMake sure to use our Slack workspace to meet fellow attendees, seek help, and exchange ideas!\n\n\n\n2. Install R  \nFollow this link, and download it for your appropriate operating system (Linux, MacOS, or Windows).\nOnce downloaded, install R on your laptop.\n\n\n3. Install RStudio  \nOnce you have already installed R, follow this link, and download RStudio for your appropriate operating system.\nIf multiple download options appear, select “Free RStudio Desktop”.\nOnce downloaded, install RStudio on your laptop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can run R without RStudio, but you cannot run RStudio without R.\nR is the main software, RStudio is an extra software that makes our lives easier when working with R by providing an integrated development environment.\n\n\n\n\n4. Install packages  \nIf you are not familiar with R lingo, you can think of a package as an app on your phone: a package will extend R functionality by making available to you extra software options that do not come pre-installed with R.\nWe will be using multiple packages that need to be installed, and doing so before the workshop will ensure that no one gets behind.\nAfter installing R and RStudio, follow these steps:\n\nDownload this R script\n\nDouble-click the R script (this will open it in RStudio)\n\nOn the same RStudio window that just opened, install each package at a time by placing your cursor on the first script line and hitting Ctrl + return (Windows) or Command + return (Mac)\n\nSome text will start appearing on the console as the packages get installed\n\nKeep running each line as described above until you reach the last package installation (script line 14)\n\nTo ensure that each package was installed, run the code starting with library(\"ggplot2\"), line by line (from script lines 18 to 29).\nIf after running the library() function you get an error message like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError in library(“packagename”) :\nthere is no package called `packagename\n\n\nThis means the package was not properly installed and you may need help.\n\n\n5. Download material from GitHub  \nThis will be a live coding workshop, meaning that we will develop the scripts together.\nTo download the initial partially-filled scripts and the data set, click here and follow the instructions.\nAt the end of the workshop, I will provide the completed scripts for your reference.\n\nOnce you have\n\nJoined the Slack workspace\n\nDownloaded and installed R\n\nDownloaded and installed RStudio\n\nInstalled needed R packages\n\nDownloaded material from GitHub\n\nThen you are ready for the workshop!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you run into issues at any of the steps above, let us know, preferably before Sunday, via Slack.\nWe need to make sure everyone is ready to go at 9 am, we will have very limited time for troubleshooting technical issues during the workshop!\n\n\nI’m excited to be seeing you all soon!\nLeo."

    "text": "Course description and details\n\nDescription\nThe course will emphasize sampling plan, obtaining and processing, and using various agricultural geospatial data layers for decision making related to precision agriculture. Data types used in the course include publicly available like weather, soils, and satellite remote sensing, and private data like yield monitor, Veris-derived soil electrical conductivity and elevation, and UAV remote sensing. Data processing steps include cleaning, removal of outliers, normalization, interpolation, and UAV imagery processing. Analytical techniques include clustering for creation of management zones, zone-based and imagery-based variable rate prescription, profitability maps, and use of satellite remote sensing for crop scouting. All steps will be conducted utilizing the R statistical language to create well documented and reproducible precision agriculture analytical workflows. No previous knowledge in R is required.\n\n\nCourse learning outcomes\nProvide students with a good understanding of the emerging areas in precision agriculture, the ability to find, analyze and evaluate spatially distributed data sets, and the experience to use key precision agriculture tools and technologies.

    "text": "1 Materials Required:\n\nSoil sampler\n10-liter buckets (2)\nSpatula or soil-removing tool\nPaper bags\nRubber bands\nPlastic tub\nWD-40 (for lubrication of soil sampler)\n\n\n\n2 Before going to the field:\n\nCheck the weather forecast to ensure that the field is dry enough for sampling. If it rains, the soil may be too wet, which can affect the quality of the soil samples.\nLabel paper bags properly and arrange them in bundles according to the sampling blocks. This will help you keep track of the samples and avoid confusion later on.\nOur bag labels should include:\n\n\n\nStudy year and name\n\nDate\n\nPlot number\n\nDepth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabel example\n\n\n\n2023 Corn split\nMarch 15\n101\n0-15 cm\n\n\n\n\n3 Sampling in the field:\n\nRemove any debris or vegetation from the soil surface to ensure that the sample is representative of the underlying soil.\nPlace the bucket in the plot you want to sample. If you are taking samples at different depths, place paper bags in the different buckets according to soil depth to avoid confusion later on.\nTake a soil sample using the soil sampler from 0-30 cm depth. Remove the lower 15 cm of soil using a spatula or a tool and place soil in the bucket of 16-30 cm depth, and the above soil in the other bucket. Repeat this process to collect 8-10 more soil samples randomly throughout the plot to make a composite sample.\nOnce you collect 8-10 soil samples, thoroughly mix the soil in the bucket and transfer enough soil into the paper for that depth to fill half of the bag.\nCheck the label on the bag that everything is right such as date of sampling, plot number, depth, and any other relevant information such as soil type, and vegetation cover.\nFold the bag from top to close the bag, and wrap a rubber band around it.\nClean the buckets and soil sampler before moving to a new plot. If soil is sticking to the auger, use WD-40 for lubrication.\n\n\n\n4 After soil collection:\n\nPack soil bags properly so the soil cannot fall out. Put them in the plastic tub to avoid any moisture contamination during transportation.\nOpen the paper bags once you reach the lab for air drying. Soil bags can break due to moisture, which can lead to the mixing of soil samples.\nLet the soil air dry for a week in a cool, dry place. Do not expose the samples to direct sunlight or store them in areas with high humidity. Once the soil samples are dry, pack them and send them to the lab for analysis.\nStore the remaining samples in a cool, dry place until your study ends or you receive results from the lab and is satisfied with the report. Avoid storing them in direct sunlight or in areas with high humidity. Also, keep the samples organized and labeled properly for easy retrieval and future reference."

    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Before Your Planned Flight:\n\nCharge the Batteries: Ensure that all batteries are fully charged, including:\n\nDrone\nController\nTablet\nGPS\n\nCheck the Weather Forecast: Avoid flying in rainy or cloudy conditions and check for any changes in the weather forecast before your flight.\nCheck for Updates: Check for any software or firmware updates for your drone and install them before your flight.\nPlan Your Flight: Plan the flight path, set up waypoints or specific areas to capture, and consider the altitude, speed, and other flight parameters.\nNote all parameters in a notebook for backup, so if by mistake you delete or change any parameters, you can have an original backup as all flights should have the same parameters.\nCheck for Permissions: Check for any permissions needed to fly in the area, especially if an airport is nearby.\nCheck the Memory Card: Make sure the memory card has enough storage space for the imagery you plan to capture.\n2 Before going to the field:\nTake Your License: Bring your drone license, such as the FAA Part 107 certificate.\nTake necessary equipment with you, such as a\n\nGCP (Ground Control Point) panel bag\nGPS system to collect GCP points\nTablet\nSensor box\nDrone box\n\nCheck the Weather Again: Ensure the weather conditions are safe to fly and avoid flying in extreme weather conditions.\nProperly Arrange and Secure Equipment: Securely pack the drone and batteries in the box for transportation.\nPlan to Fly During Optimal Sunlight Hours: Plan to fly the drone between 10:00 am to 2:00 pm when the sun is at the top for optimal lighting conditions (solar noon).\n\n\n\n3 Checks to be done before drone flight:\n\nCheck the Weather: Make sure the weather conditions are safe to fly and avoid flying in extreme weather conditions.\nCheck for Permission: Ensure that you have permission to fly in the location and that it is safe to do so. Check for any potential obstacles such as power lines, buildings, trees, and other hazards.\nSet up Ground Control Points: Set up any necessary ground control points, markers, or reference points for georeferencing the images.\nPlace and Secure the Drone Pad: Place a drone pad and secure it properly by pegging it in the soil.\nAssemble the Drone: Take the drone out of the box, place it on the pad, and assemble it by locking the flying arms and attaching the propellers according to their position.\nAttach the Altum Sensor: Attach the Altum sensor to the drone and connect the sunshine sensor.\nLoad Batteries and Flight Plan: Load the batteries into the drone, check their levels, load the proper flight plan, and remove the cover from the sensor.\nTake Calibration Images: Take two to three images of the calibration board before the flight.\nYou are ready to fly.\n\n\n\n4 After flight procedures:\n\nTake Calibration Images Again: Take images of the calibration board again after the flight.\nRemove Batteries and Sensor: Remove the batteries and the Altum sensor from the drone.\nLet Batteries Cool: Let the batteries cool down before packing them into the box.\nInspect the Drone: Inspect the drone for any damage and ensure that all parts are working correctly.\nClean the Drone: Clean the drone after each flight to ensure that it is free from dirt and debris.\nTransfer raw imagery from sd card to your computer.\nMake sure imagery was collected BEFORE leaving the field. If something happened and no imagery was collected, fly again."
