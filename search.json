    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nNitrogen (N) is the most common limiting nutrient to optimum corn yields. Within-field variability in soil characteristics and properties like elevation, slope, texture, bulk density, organic matter, nutrient concentration, and pH can create variable N availability, corn growth, and yield potential.\nThe detection of within-field corn growth variability and its proper management can be performed using crop canopy sensors. These sensors vary distance to the plants and in sensor-related resolutions (spatial, temporal, spectral, and radiometric). Commonly used crop canopy sensors include proximal (<1 m from plants) and remote (ranging from 50 m with UAVs to orbital distances with satellite). Proximal and remote sensors have their own advantages and disadvantages, with proximal sensors generally being more sensitive to crop growth differences but less scalable than remote sensors.\nThe use of in-season crop canopy sensors to variably apply N in corn has been intensively studied in the US Midwest, Brazil, Argentina, and Australia corn growing regions. However, limited studies have been conducted in the US Southeast region with its particular warmer climates and sandier soils.\nTherefore, more studies are needed to understand the potential of variable rate N management to maintain and improve corn yield, N use efficiency, and profitability in the challenging environments of the US Southeast region.\n\n\nHypothesis and Objectives\nWe hypothesize that\n\nthe use of proximal, UAV, and satellite sensors will produce similar in-season variable rate N rates in corn,\nsensor-based N management will yield at least similarly to a flat-rate approach,\nsensor-based N management will be more efficient in the use of N compared to a flat-rate approach.\n\nThe objectives of this study are to assess\n\nhow different are N rates when calculated using proximal, UAV, and satellite data,\nthe effect of sensor-based nutrient management in corn yield and N use efficiency\n\n\n\nTimeline\nThis study will start in the Spring of 2023.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nCotton profitability depends not only on lint yield but also on fiber quality, with price adjustments made based on quality parameters like length, strength, and micronaire. Cotton fiber quality varies both within a field and across years and is affected by genetics, environment, and management. Currently, studies reporting on the main drivers of cotton fiber quality are limited in space and/or time, and thus cannot be generalized. Therefore, there exists a gap in knowledge in dissecting the main and interacting effects of genetics, environment, and management in cotton fiber quality over multiple years and across multiple sites within a region.\n\n\nHypothesis and Objectives\nWe hypothesize that\n\nDifferent cotton fiber quality variables are affected to different extents by genetics (choice of variety), environmental conditions (e.g., growing season rainfall volume and distribution, air and soil temperature, soil characteristics), management practices (seeding rate, fertilizer program, plant growth regulator and defoliant program, harvest date), and their interactions. \nIt is possible to dissect the main drivers of specific fiber quality parameters and overall loan rate.\n\nThe objective of this study is to use multi-site-year small-plot trial data collected across the Southern U.S.A. region to dissect the effects of genetics, environment, and management on different cotton fiber quality parameters and overall loan rate.\n\n\nTimeline\nA timeline for the proposed project is outlined in Figure 1. The project would officially start on July 2022 with data collection (field, environmental, and management) for the state of Georgia. The first report would be created by March of 2023 as a white paper for John Deere, with results potentially being presented at scientific conferences following non-disclosure agreement guidelines. After data and report for Georgia has been completed, efforts will shift to reach out to other cotton-producing states to broaden the scope of the database. The second and final report will be finished by June 2024, immediately shared with John Deere and potentially submitted for peer-reviewed journal publication following non-disclosure agreement guidelines.\n\n\n\nFig 1.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nCotton quality is a very important aspect of cotton production because it directly influences how much a grower gets paid. Cotton is harvested and processed at a gin before samples can be taken for quality analysis, so learning about your cotton quality and final price can take a while.\nWhat if cotton growers could learn about cotton lint quality even before harvest? That is the task we set out to answer.\n\n\nMethods\nFor that, cotton harvesters with Harvest Identification technology were used in 9 commercial cotton fields. The harvesters collected yield data and included radio frequency identification tags to each module as they were assembled.\nUsing the harvest identification technology, we were able to georeference cotton quality parameters to sub-field locations, and match them with soil topography and remote sensing data.\nDifferent quality parameters like color, leaf grade, and strength, were used to calculate loan rate, which is a unified cotton quality number related to the value of cotton based on its quality. Loan rate is expressed in cents/lb cotton, and the larger it is, the higher quality cotton is and more a grower gets paid.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil topography data included elevation, slope, aspect, and flow direction. Here, we are only showing elevation for simplicity.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote sensing data was retrieved from the period between May 1st and August 31st from Sentinel-2 through Google Earth Engine for a total of 49 dates. Satellite data was used to calculate the green normalized difference index, GNDVI. GNDVI was summarized by extracting minimum, median, and maximum values during the growing season for each pixel in the field. Here, we are only showing GNDVI maximum for simplicity.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckout below a timelapse for all GNDVI images from which GNDVI max was extracted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary results and next steps\nWe found that greater loan rate values (>56 cents/lb cotton) were associated with lower elevation and lower growing-season maximum GNDVI for this field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, cotton quality can be spatially predicted using soil and remote sensing data.\nFuture work will include more fields with their associated weather data, more remote sensors, vegetation indices, and more complex machine learning algorithms to predict cotton quality.\nOnce validated, this project can be transformed into a tool that can impact different players in the cotton industry. For example, cotton growers will know what parts of their fields produce better quality cotton, and use this information for differential management and marketing purposes. On the other end, the textile industry will know what regions produce better-quality cotton. This information can be used to target the purchase of cotton from high-quality growing regions and ensure their yarn quality needs are met."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nCotton is a perennial crop that we requires intensive management to be “annualized” (i.e., having a growing cycle that starts and ends within one growing season).\nBecause of its perennial nature, cotton growth needs to be modulated by i) providing both the proper amount of nutrients (where nitrogen-N is the one applied at greatest rates), and ii) ensuring its use of resources (like N) is properly partitioned between vegetative and reproductive growth. With that, optimum cotton lint yield is attained by providing enough (and not more than that) N while applying plant growth regulators (PGR) to curb excessive vegetative growth in lieu of reproductive.\nWithin-field variability in soil characteristics and properties like elevation, slope, texture, bulk density, organic matter, nutrient concentration, and pH can create variable cotton growth and yield potential. Cotton plants with variable growth will require different rates of N and PGR to attain proper vegetative/reproductive partitioning and achieve their yield potential. In-season variable rate N and PGR management can be used to better match input application rates with cotton growth requirements, increasing input use efficiency, optimizing yield, and increasing farm profitability.\nThe detection of within-field cotton growth variability and its proper management can be performed using crop canopy sensors. These sensors vary distance to the plants and in sensor-related resolutions (spatial, temporal, spectral, and radiometric). Commonly used crop canopy sensors include proximal (<1 m from plants) and remote (ranging from 50 m with UAVs to orbital distances with satellite).

    "section": "",
    "text": "Starting on August 2022, John Deere and the University of Georgia joined efforts to study the main drivers of cotton lint quality through a meta-analysis approach.\n\n\nSince then, cotton fiber quality data from 24 site studies conducted in Georgia in 2020 were gathered.\n\nFrom each site, harvested cotton seed was ginned and analyzed for lint quality. Quality variables included:\n\nFiber length\n\nFiber length uniformity\n\nMicronaire\n\nStrength\n\nReflectance (Rd)\n\nYellowness (+b)\n\nLeaf percentage\n\n\n\n\nThe centroid coordinates of each of the sites were used to retrieve and extract publicly available data sets for daily weather (PRISM, 4.6-km spatial resolution) and soil properties (POLARIS, 30-m spatial resolution).\nDaily weather variables of precipitation, air temperature (min, mean, max), and vapor pressure deficit were summarized (summed or averaged) on a monthly basis for the months between April and November. A total of 48 summarized weather variables were created.\nSoil properties of bulk density, sand, clay, silt, organic matter, and pH for the layers 0-5, 5-15, and 15-30 cm depth were summarized by averaging within a site. A total of 19 summarized soil variables were created.\nEach of the 7 lint quality variables were regressed against each of the summarized environmental variables, for a total of 469 models evaluated. For each lint quality variable, the environmental variable model with the greatest correlation was selected."
