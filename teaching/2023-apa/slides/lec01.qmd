<br/><br/>

All classes will be recorded and further posted on the class YouTube channel.  

<br/><br/>

This should be used as a supporting study tool and make-up for content from missed classes. **Recordings do not replace in-person/remote attendance**.

## Attendance policy

Students are expected to attend every class period.  

<br/><br/>

Students on the **Athens campus** must attend class in-person.  

<br/><br/>

If a special circumstance arise (illness, travel, etc.), student absence or remote attendance **must be informed to instructors prior to that class period**.  

## Attendance policy

Students are expected to attend every class period.  

<br/><br/>

Students on the **Tifton and Griffin campuses** may attend class in-person on their campuses or remote using the zoom link information.  

<br/><br/>

Student absence **must be informed to instructors prior to that class period**.  


## Attendance policy

Students are expected to attend every class period.  

<br/><br/>

Per Board of Regents policy, I reserve the right to drop students from the class roll who **miss more than 5 class periods**. Such students will be given a WF grade.

## Attendance policy

::: {.callout-note}  
##  

When attending a class remotely via zoom, students are expected to have **cameras on at all times**.
:::

## Technology and software requirements

Students will need to have access to:

-   A computer :computer: (to install software, code along with instructors)\
-   A second screen :tv: (main screen to code along, second screen to watch class if not in person)  

. . . 

If a student does not have access to these resources (personal laptop/desktop and a second screen), please let instructors know to ensure proper accommodations can be made.

## Survey  

Please go to the link below and fill this survey:

[https://forms.gle/M78MDXLrtXBVUHyt7](https://forms.gle/M78MDXLrtXBVUHyt7)  

Take 5 minutes to answer it.  

## Getting ready for next class  

To be ready for next class (**Intro to R**), please go to the course main page and follow the link to the `Lab 01 prep` page.  

<br/><br/>

If you have questions or issues, email me **before class**.

We will have limited time to troubleshoot technical problems during next period.

# Thanks, and see you on Wednesday!
