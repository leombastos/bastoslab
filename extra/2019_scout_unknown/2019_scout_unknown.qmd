# Background and methods

This page is intended to quickly share remote sensing data collected on a field reported with unknown issues grown with corn in 2019.

Imagery was retrieved from Sentinel-2 archive starting on 2019-04-01 through 2019-10-31. Only images with less than 40% cloud coverage were kept.

Imagery data were used to calculate green normalized difference index (GNDVI), from which was created an animated time lapse of GNDVI during the selected period.
