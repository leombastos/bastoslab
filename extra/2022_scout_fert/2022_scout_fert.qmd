# Background and methods

This page is intended to quickly share remote sensing data collected on a field reported with fertility/pH issues grown with corn in 2022.

Imagery was retrieved from Sentinel-2 archive starting on 2022-04-01 through 2022-10-17. Only images with less than 40% cloud coverage were kept.

Imagery data were used to calculate green normalized difference index (GNDVI), from which was created an animated time lapse of GNDVI during the selected period.
